## My Approach
I have utilizes `Angular.js` which is a JavaScript framework to created a single page dynamic web application. Although I have worked on projects on both `React` and `Angular`. I preferred due to the fact that I am more used to and comfortable using it.
### # Here are the Key Take away from the project
* I have used `Reactive.js` as I have used `Observables` instead of Promises which are helpful in making async calls to the server.
* I have also used` angular2-infinite-scroll` by orizens which is helpful in infinite scrolling of pages
